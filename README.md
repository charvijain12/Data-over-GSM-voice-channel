DRDO Project to achieve end to end data communication over mobile voice channel.

                                     Introduction
The Universal Data Communication Module (UDCM) is a module that enables end-to-end data communication over the GSM voice channel. The module is designed to transmit low bit rate data communication when a data channel is not available. UDCM can be interfaced with any mobile phone’s voice port and use the audio path of the mobile phone to send the data. The UDCM module has been developed to provide reliable, error-free, full-duplex data communication over the GSM voice channel.

                                      Requirements
The UDCM module must meet the following requirements:

•Provide a minimum of 2400 bps data communication over the GSM voice channel.
•Feed the modulated signal to the mobile phone at the 3.5mm jack.
•Use the audio path of the mobile phone, not the data path.
•Perform seamlessly on any mobile phone brand (i.e. Samsung, One Plus, Apple, etc.) and the performance shall not differ from one model to another.
•Work in the absence of mobile data/Wi-Fi of the phone (i.e. not use VoIP path).
•Not use any data compression techniques.
•Appropriate FEC and modulation techniques can be used to achieve the required throughput.

                                        Use Case
The UDCM module takes data from a PC, modulates it and transfers the modulated data to the mobile phone at the transmitter end. At the receiver end, the process is reversed, and the modulated data is demodulated, allowing the data to be retrieved from the mobile phone.

                                       Conclusion
The UDCM module is a standalone module that allows low bit rate data communication over the GSM voice channel. The module has been developed to provide reliable, error-free, full-duplex data communication using appropriate FEC and modulation techniques. It can be used seamlessly on any mobile phone brand and should not use data compression techniques.
